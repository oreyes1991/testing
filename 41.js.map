Most recently it has been recognized as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.\r\n\t\tThis impressing archaeological site has been steadily growing in popularity and currently receives over 2500 tourists daily.  Veteran guide Lucio explains that “due to increasing demand, the areas accessible to visitors are reduced and increasingly restricted every year.”  Today the visitors are still able to go inside and touch most the ancient structures of Machu Picchu allowing for a very intimate and personal experience.  In coming years the tours will be restricted to fenced-off pathways and single file lines.`,\r\n\t\tblockquote: `\"A construction project of this magnitude in such a lofty location would require teams of architects, engineers, and geologists of ancient Peru.\"`,\r\n\t\tauthor: 'Cameron Metreaud',\r\n\t\tdate: 'November 06, 2017',\r\n\t\turl_image: 'images/tours/cuzco/machu_picchu_main.png',\r\n\t\ttour: 'tourscuzco.html#machu-picchu-day-trip',\r\n\t\tid: '4',\r\n\t\tlink: 'article-detail.html?id=4'\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttitle:'Nasca Lines from Pisco',\r\n\t\tsubtitle:\"*New* Nasca lines tours with regular flights from Pisco's renovated airport\",\r\n\t\tblockquote:`“Before, the only way to see the Nasca lines was to travel to Nasca - usually by bus.
